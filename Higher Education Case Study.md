# Analysis of Factors Impacting Academic Performance

## Introduction and Research Question/Hypothesis

### Introduction
This report analyzes the factors impacting academic performance among higher education students, using a dataset containing various student demographics, family background, study habits, and academic records. Understanding these influences helps educators and administrators develop strategies to support student success and retention.

### Research Question
What factors most significantly impact the academic performance of higher education students, as measured by their grades?

### Hypothesis
Looking at the dataset beforehand, we hypothesize that study hours and attendance will be key predictors of academic performance. We also expect that demographic factors, such as age and gender, will have some influence on grades.

## Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis

### Data Overview
The dataset consists of various attributes related to the students, including demographics, family background, study habits, and academic measures. Key features include:
- **CUML_GPA** (Cumulative GPA)
- **STUDY_HRS** (Study hours)
- **GRADE** (Final grade in a course)
- **AGE** (Age of the student)
- **MOTHER_EDU** and **FATHER_EDU** (Parental education levels)

### Data Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Handling Identifiers**: 
    - The **STUDENTID** column was removed, as it is simply an identifier without predictive value.
  
2. **Target Variable**: 
    - The **GRADE** column was chosen as the target variable, representing the academic performance measure we aim to predict.
  
3. **Normalization**: 
    - Continuous variables were standardized to improve model performance and comparability across features.
  
4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: 
    - Variables like **GENDER**, **MOTHER_EDU**, and **FATHER_EDU** were encoded to allow for numerical analysis.
  
5. **Feature Exclusion**: 
    - **STUDENTID** and **COURSE ID** were excluded from the feature set to avoid course-specific biases in predicting general academic performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. **Distribution of Study Hours**:
    - A histogram of **STUDY_HRS** indicated that most students study between 1 and 5 hours per week, with fewer students studying significantly more.

2. **Grade Correlation Analysis**:
    - A correlation heatmap highlighted a strong correlation between **CUML_GPA** and **GRADE**, as well as moderate correlations with **MOTHER_EDU** and **FATHER_EDU**.

3. **Feature Visualizations**:
    - Scatter plots and box plots were used to visualize the relationship between study hours, attendance, and grades. Initial observations suggested that **CUML_GPA** had the strongest relationship with **GRADE**.

## Analysis Methods and Results

### Modeling Approach:
- A **Random Forest Regressor** was chosen to predict the continuous target variable **GRADE**, as it handles non-linear relationships well and provides feature importance scores, which are useful for interpretation.
- After training the model, we evaluated its performance using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**.

### Feature Importance Results:
The feature importance analysis revealed that:
- **CUML_GPA** was the strongest predictor of **GRADE**, indicating that cumulative academic performance has the most significant impact on current academic success.
- **GENDER** emerged as the second most important feature, suggesting potential performance differences between male and female students.
- **Parental Education Levels (FATHER_EDU and MOTHER_EDU)** were also influential, highlighting the role of family background in academic achievement.
- **CLASSROOM** and **AGE**: The classroom environment and student age showed moderate importance, potentially reflecting differences in learning experiences and maturity.

### Model Performance:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 
    - The model’s MSE indicated the average squared difference between predicted and actual grades, showing reasonable predictive accuracy.
  
- **R² Score**: 
    - The **R² Score** suggested that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in **GRADE**, largely driven by **CUML_GPA** and other factors like parental education and gender.

## Interpretation of Findings

### Key Insights:
1. **Cumulative Performance (CUML_GPA)**: 
    - As expected, **CUML_GPA** was highly predictive of individual course grades. This suggests that long-term academic habits and achievements are reliable indicators of current performance.

2. **Demographic Influence (Gender, Age)**:
    - The impact of gender as the second most important feature implies potential academic performance differences that could stem from social factors or differences in learning approaches. **Age** also plays a role, possibly reflecting maturity or life experience differences among students.

3. **Parental Education**:
    - **Parental education levels (MOTHER_EDU and FATHER_EDU)** emerged as significant predictors, emphasizing the role of family support and socio-economic background in academic success. Higher parental education often correlates with increased academic resources and a supportive learning environment at home.

4. **Classroom and Study Hours**:
    - While **study hours** were important, they had less impact than expected. This suggests that quality of study time or cumulative habits (as reflected by **CUML_GPA**) might matter more than quantity. The **classroom environment** also influences performance, indicating that educational settings and resources could play a role in supporting student success.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion:
This analysis confirmed that **CUML_GPA** is the most critical factor in predicting academic performance (**GRADE**), likely because it reflects established academic habits. **Demographic factors** such as gender and **parental education levels** also play substantial roles, suggesting that both inherent abilities and family backgrounds contribute to academic outcomes. **Classroom environment** and **age** contribute to academic performance but are less impactful than cumulative GPA.

### Recommendations:
1. **Academic Support Programs**:
    - Given the importance of **CUML_GPA**, providing additional academic support early in students' academic careers could help improve their cumulative performance and, by extension, their future grades.

2. **Targeted Support Based on Family Background**:
    - Students whose parents have lower educational levels might benefit from additional resources, such as tutoring or mentoring, to level the playing field.

3. **Gender-Specific Programs**:
    - The influence of gender suggests that targeted support, possibly addressing learning styles or mentorship, could benefit students and bridge any performance gaps.

4. **Classroom Environment Improvements**:
    - Since **CLASSROOM** has some impact on performance, ensuring a positive, resource-rich learning environment could improve academic outcomes across the board.

### Next Steps:
Future analyses could focus on understanding the specific classroom factors that enhance student performance, as well as exploring more in-depth support programs tailored to different family backgrounds and genders.
